# Improving Large File Uploads in Swift: From Single Upload to Chunked Approach

When dealing with file uploads in iOS applications, especially for large files, efficient memory management is crucial. In this post, we'll explore how we transitioned from a simple single upload method to a more efficient chunked upload approach, addressing memory management issues along the way.

## The Original Approach: Single Upload

Initially, our file upload method looked something like this:

```swift
static func singleFileUpload(data: Data?, fileName: String, format: String = "zip") async -> String? {
    return await withCheckedContinuation({ continuation in
        guard let data = data else {
            continuation.resume(returning: nil)
            return
        }
        
        let key = UUID().uuidString + ".\(format)"
        let bucketName = "your-bucket-name"
        
        let s3 = S3(/* Configure S3 client */)
        
        let putObjectRequest = S3.PutObjectRequest(
            acl: .publicRead,
            body: .data(data),
            bucket: bucketName,
            key: key
        )
        
        let result = s3.putObject(putObjectRequest)
        
        result.whenSuccess { _ in
            let url = "https://your-s3-endpoint/\(bucketName)/\(key)"
            continuation.resume(returning: url)
        }
        
        result.whenFailure { error in
            print("Upload failed: \(error)")
            continuation.resume(returning: nil)
        }
    })
}
```

### Issues with the Single Upload Approach

1. **Memory Usage**: The entire file is loaded into memory at once, which can be problematic for large files.
2. **App Stability**: For very large files, this could lead to memory warnings or even app crashes.
3. **Upload Limitations**: Some servers have limits on the size of a single upload request.
4. **Lack of Progress Tracking**: It's difficult to provide accurate progress information to the user.
5. **No Resume Capability**: If the upload fails, the entire process must start over.

## The Improved Approach: Chunked Upload

To address these issues, we implemented a chunked upload method:

```swift
static func chunkedFileUpload(fileURL: URL, bucket: String, key: String) async -> Result<String, Error> {
    return await withCheckedContinuation({ continuation in
        let fileManager = FileManager.default
        guard let attributes = try? fileManager.attributesOfItem(atPath: fileURL.path),
              let fileSize = attributes[.size] as? Int64 else {
            continuation.resume(returning: .failure(NSError(domain: "FileError", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Unable to get file attributes"])))
            return
        }
        
        print("File size: \(fileSize) bytes")
        
        let s3 = S3(/* Configure S3 client */)
        
        let multipartUpload = s3.createMultipartUpload(.init(bucket: bucket, key: key))
        
        multipartUpload.whenSuccess { createMultipartUploadOutput in
            guard let uploadId = createMultipartUploadOutput.uploadId else {
                continuation.resume(returning: .failure(NSError(domain: "UploadError", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to get uploadId"])))
                return
            }
            
            let chunkSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB chunks
            var partNumber = 1
            var uploadedParts: [S3.CompletedPart] = []
            
            func uploadNextChunk() {
                autoreleasepool {
                    guard let fileHandle = try? FileHandle(forReadingFrom: fileURL) else {
                        continuation.resume(returning: .failure(NSError(domain: "FileError", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Unable to open file"])))
                        return
                    }
                    
                    fileHandle.seek(toFileOffset: UInt64((partNumber - 1) * chunkSize))
                    let chunkData = fileHandle.readData(ofLength: chunkSize)
                    
                    if chunkData.isEmpty {
                        fileHandle.closeFile()
                        
                        // All parts uploaded, complete multipart upload
                        let completeMultipartUpload = s3.completeMultipartUpload(.init(
                            bucket: bucket,
                            key: key,
                            multipartUpload: .init(parts: uploadedParts),
                            uploadId: uploadId
                        ))
                        
                        completeMultipartUpload.whenSuccess { _ in
                            let path = "https://your-s3-endpoint/\(bucket)/\(key)"
                            continuation.resume(returning: .success(path))
                        }
                        
                        completeMultipartUpload.whenFailure { error in
                            continuation.resume(returning: .failure(error))
                        }
                    } else {
                        let upload = s3.uploadPart(.init(
                            body: .data(chunkData),
                            bucket: bucket,
                            key: key,
                            partNumber: Int(partNumber),
                            uploadId: uploadId
                        ))
                        
                        upload.whenSuccess { response in
                            if let eTag = response.eTag {
                                uploadedParts.append(.init(eTag: eTag, partNumber: Int(partNumber)))
                                partNumber += 1
                                fileHandle.closeFile()
                                uploadNextChunk()
                            } else {
                                fileHandle.closeFile()
                                continuation.resume(returning: .failure(NSError(domain: "UploadError", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to get eTag"])))
                            }
                        }
                        
                        upload.whenFailure { error in
                            fileHandle.closeFile()
                            continuation.resume(returning: .failure(error))
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            
            uploadNextChunk()
        }
        
        multipartUpload.whenFailure { error in
            continuation.resume(returning: .failure(error))
        }
    })
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Efficient Memory Usage**: 
   - Before: Entire file loaded into memory
   - After: Only one chunk (5MB) in memory at a time
   - Benefit: Significantly reduced memory footprint, especially for large files

2. **Scalability**:
   - Before: Limited by device memory
   - After: Can handle files of any size
   - Benefit: Improved app stability and ability to upload large files

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Before: Difficult to provide accurate progress
   - After: Can easily calculate progress based on uploaded chunks
   - Benefit: Better user experience with accurate progress reporting

4. **Resumable Uploads**:
   - Before: Failed uploads start over
   - After: Can potentially resume from last successful chunk
   - Benefit: More resilient to network issues, saves time and bandwidth

5. **Resource Management**:
   - Before: Entire file held in memory
   - After: File handle opened and closed for each chunk
   - Benefit: More efficient use of system resources

6. **Flexibility**:
   - Before: Single upload method
   - After: Multipart upload with customizable chunk size
   - Benefit: Can be optimized for different network conditions or file types

## Memory Management Benefits

The chunked approach significantly improves memory management:

1. **Controlled Memory Usage**: By reading and uploading the file in small chunks, we prevent large memory spikes.

2. **Autorelease Pool**: Each chunk upload is wrapped in an autorelease pool, ensuring temporary objects are deallocated promptly.

3. **Explicit Resource Handling**: File handles are opened and closed for each chunk, preventing resource leaks.

4. **Scalability**: This approach can handle files of any size without significant increase in memory usage.

## Conclusion

By transitioning from a single upload to a chunked upload approach, we've created a more efficient, scalable, and robust solution for handling file uploads, especially for large files. The key improvements focus on reducing memory usage, improving resource management, and enhancing the overall reliability of the upload process.

When implementing file uploads in your iOS applications, consider adopting a chunked approach to ensure your app can handle files of any size efficiently without compromising performance or user experience.

Remember to test your implementation with various file sizes and under different network conditions to ensure robustness and efficiency.
