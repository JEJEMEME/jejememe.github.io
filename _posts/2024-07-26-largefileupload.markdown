# Optimizing Large File Uploads in Swift: Efficient Data Handling with Memory Mapping

In our ongoing efforts to improve large file uploads in iOS applications, we've discovered that the way we handle `Data` objects is crucial for efficient memory management. A key aspect of this is the use of memory mapping, which can significantly improve performance and reduce memory overhead. Let's dive deep into how we implemented this in our chunked upload method.

## The Importance of Memory Mapping

Memory mapping is a technique that maps a file directly into the address space of a process. This can be more efficient than reading the entire file into memory, especially for large files. In Swift, we can use the `.mappedIfSafe` option when creating a `Data` object from a file to take advantage of this technique.

## Implementation with Memory Mapping

Here's how we implemented our chunked upload method with memory mapping:

```swift
static func chunkedFileUpload(fileURL: URL, bucket: String, key: String) async -> Result<String, Error> {
    return await withCheckedContinuation({ continuation in
        print("Attempting to upload file at path: \(fileURL.path)")
        
        let fileManager = FileManager.default
        
        // Check file existence and attributes
        guard let attributes = try? fileManager.attributesOfItem(atPath: fileURL.path),
              let fileSize = attributes[.size] as? Int64 else {
            let error = NSError(domain: "FileError", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Unable to get file attributes: \(fileURL.path)"])
            print(error.localizedDescription)
            continuation.resume(returning: .failure(error))
            return
        }
        
        print("File size: \(fileSize) bytes")
        
        // S3 configuration
        let s3 = S3(/* Configure S3 client */)
        
        // Create multipart upload
        let multipartUpload = s3.createMultipartUpload(.init(bucket: bucket, key: key))
        
        multipartUpload.whenSuccess { createMultipartUploadOutput in
            guard let uploadId = createMultipartUploadOutput.uploadId else {
                let error = NSError(domain: "UploadError", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to get uploadId"])
                print(error.localizedDescription)
                continuation.resume(returning: .failure(error))
                return
            }
            
            // Set chunk size (e.g., 5MB)
            let chunkSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024
            var partNumber = 1
            var uploadedParts: [S3.CompletedPart] = []
            
            // Read and upload file in chunks
            func uploadNextChunk() {
                autoreleasepool {
                    do {
                        // Use memory mapping to efficiently handle large files
                        let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL, options: .mappedIfSafe)
                        let startIndex = (partNumber - 1) * chunkSize
                        let endIndex = min(startIndex + chunkSize, data.count)
                        
                        if startIndex >= data.count {
                            // All parts uploaded, complete multipart upload
                            print("All parts uploaded. Completing multipart upload.")
                            let completeMultipartUpload = s3.completeMultipartUpload(.init(
                                bucket: bucket,
                                key: key,
                                multipartUpload: .init(parts: uploadedParts),
                                uploadId: uploadId
                            ))
                            
                            completeMultipartUpload.whenSuccess { _ in
                                let path = "https://your-s3-endpoint/\(bucket)/\(key)"
                                print("Upload completed successfully. Path: \(path)")
                                continuation.resume(returning: .success(path))
                            }
                            
                            completeMultipartUpload.whenFailure { error in
                                print("Failed to complete multipart upload: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                                continuation.resume(returning: .failure(error))
                            }
                        } else {
                            let chunkData = data.subdata(in: startIndex..<endIndex)
                            print("Uploading part \(partNumber) (size: \(chunkData.count) bytes)")
                            
                            // Upload part
                            let upload = s3.uploadPart(.init(
                                body: .data(chunkData),
                                bucket: bucket,
                                key: key,
                                partNumber: Int(partNumber),
                                uploadId: uploadId
                            ))
                            
                            upload.whenSuccess { response in
                                if let eTag = response.eTag {
                                    uploadedParts.append(.init(eTag: eTag, partNumber: Int(partNumber)))
                                    partNumber += 1
                                    uploadNextChunk()
                                } else {
                                    let error = NSError(domain: "UploadError", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to get eTag"])
                                    print(error.localizedDescription)
                                    continuation.resume(returning: .failure(error))
                                }
                            }
                            
                            upload.whenFailure { error in
                                print("Failed to upload part \(partNumber): \(error.localizedDescription)")

                        }

## Key Improvements in Data Handling

1. **Memory Mapping with `.mappedIfSafe`**: 
   ```swift
   let data = try Data(contentsOf: fileURL, options: .mappedIfSafe)
   ```
   - This option attempts to memory-map the file if it's safe to do so.
   - Benefits:
     - Reduced memory overhead: The entire file isn't loaded into memory at once.
     - Improved performance: The OS can efficiently manage file access.
     - Better scalability: Can handle very large files more easily.

2. **Chunked Reading**:
   ```swift
   let startIndex = (partNumber - 1) * chunkSize
   let endIndex = min(startIndex + chunkSize, data.count)
   let chunkData = data.subdata(in: startIndex..<endIndex)
   ```
   - We're still reading the file in chunks, even with memory mapping.
   - This ensures we're only working with a small portion of the file at a time.

3. **Autorelease Pool Usage**:
   - Each chunk processing is wrapped in an `autoreleasepool {}` block.
   - This ensures that temporary objects created during chunk processing are released promptly, preventing memory buildup.

## Deep Dive: Memory Mapping with `.mappedIfSafe`

1. **How it works**:
   - When `.mappedIfSafe` is used, the system attempts to map the file directly into memory.
   - Instead of reading the entire file into RAM, the file is mapped into virtual memory.
   - The OS handles loading the actual data from disk as needed, which can be more efficient.

2. **Benefits**:
   - **Reduced Memory Usage**: The entire file doesn't need to be in RAM at once.
   - **Faster Initial Load**: Mapping is generally faster than reading the entire file.
   - **Efficient for Large Files**: Particularly beneficial for files larger than available RAM.

3. **Safety Considerations**:
   - The `IfSafe` part means it will fall back to loading the file normally if memory mapping isn't possible or safe.
   - This can happen if the file is on a network volume, for example.

4. **Performance Impact**:
   - For small files, the performance difference might be negligible.
   - For large files, especially those larger than available RAM, the improvement can be substantial.

## Memory Management Benefits

1. **Controlled Memory Usage**: By using memory mapping and processing in chunks, we prevent large memory spikes.
2. **Efficient File Access**: The OS can optimize file access, potentially improving performance.
3. **Scalability**: This approach can handle files of any size, even those larger than available RAM.

## Conclusion

By implementing efficient data handling with memory mapping and chunking, we've created a robust solution for uploading large files. This approach significantly reduces memory usage, improves performance, and is more scalable for handling files of various sizes.

When implementing file uploads in your iOS applications, consider adopting this approach with memory mapping and chunked processing. It ensures your app can handle files of any size efficiently without compromising performance or user experience.
