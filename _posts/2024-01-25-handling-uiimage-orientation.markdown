When working with image processing in iOS, particularly with CoreML and other image manipulation frameworks, developers often face a challenge with image orientation. 
`UIImage` in iOS carries orientation information, but this is not the case with `CIImage`. 
This discrepancy can lead to significant complications, especially when images need to be correctly oriented for accurate processing.

### The Challenge with `CIImage`

Unlike `UIImage`, `CIImage` doesn't inherently handle or store orientation data. This becomes a problem during image processing tasks, such as machine learning with CoreML, where the orientation of the image is crucial for the accuracy of the results. For instance, a facial recognition model might misinterpret features if the image is not correctly oriented.

### A Swift Solution

To address this, we've developed a Swift extension for `UIImage` that ensures the image orientation is corrected before conversion to `CIImage`. This approach simplifies the process by handling the orientation at the earliest stage, thus maintaining consistency throughout the image processing workflow.

Here's the gist of the code for this extension:
